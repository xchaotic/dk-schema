					a wingspan of nearly 3m (10ft), compared to just 20cm (8in) for the smallest
					falconets from southeast Asia. Despite this huge difference in size, all birds
					of prey share a similar body plan, although with markedly different proportions,
					particularly in the shape of their wings. Birds of prey have powerful feet armed
					with sharp claws or talons, and their legs are often feathered as far as the
					ankle joint. All of them have strongly hooked bills, which they use for tearing
					up their food, rather than for catching their prey. They also have
					forward-facing eyes – a vital adaptation for judging distances accurately when
					they move in to make a kill. Owls have a similar anatomy, but unlike them,
					almost all birds of prey hunt by day.</para>

				<title xml:id="BIRD180BIRPRE_012">Wings and flight</title>
				<para xml:id="BIRD180BIRPRE_013">Even from the far distance, their distinctive wing
					shape and flight path help to identify different birds of prey. Eagles,
					buzzards, and vultures typically fly high in the sky, soaring effortlessly on
					their broad, outstretched wings. One species of African vulture – Rüppell’s
					Vulture – is on record as the highest flier of this order of birds, after
					colliding with an aircraft at over 11,000m (36,000ft). However, such high-flying
					birds are an exception, because most birds of prey operate much closer to the
					ground. Kites and harriers criss-cross open country and woodland, flying at a
					leisurely pace relatively near the ground as they watch for potential prey
					below. Birds of the kestrel family are instantly recognizable, because they are
					among the few birds of prey that hover while they watch for food. Other birds of
					prey, such as peregrines and sparrowhawks, are pursuit hunters. These have a
					flight pattern more like that of a fighter plane: they burst through the air at
					high speed, diving or swooping on other birds, which are their main prey, and
					move on straight away if they fail to make a kill.</para>

				<title xml:id="BIRD180BIRPRE_027">Hunting and diet</title>
				<para xml:id="BIRD180BIRPRE_028">Despite their reputation as heavyweight hunters,
					some birds of prey have unusual and surprising diets. The Snail Kite, for
					example, lives entirely on freshwater snails, while the Palm-nut Vulture from
					Africa feeds on the fruit of oil and raffia palms. Small falcons often prey on
					dragonflies, while some large raptors – such as the Common Buzzard – will stoop
					to eating earthworms if the weather is too cold or wet for soaring. But given
					good conditions, most raptors are specialists, concentrating on particular kinds
					of prey. The fish-eating Osprey has spiny toes which help it to grip its catch,
					while snake eagles grip their prey just behind the head, preventing it from
					striking back. In tropical forests, Harpy Eagles snatch monkeys and sloths out
					of the treetops, carrying prey weighing up to 6kg (13lb) – about two-thirds of
					their own body weight. Aerial hunters, such as Peregrine Falcons and
					sparrowhawks, can kill birds substantially bigger than themselves. The latter
					grip their prey with their talons, but Peregrine Falcons slash it as they dive
					past, leaving the stricken bird to fall tumbling to the ground, where it is
					retrieved bythe successful hunter.</para>

					<para xml:id="BIRD205KRUNAT_012">Kruger National Park is best known for its
						herds of grazing animals and for the carnivores that hunt them, but it also
						supports an extraordinary diversity of bird life, so can rank among the most
						exciting birdwatching destinations in Africa. More than 520 species of bird
						have been recorded in the reserve, including around 250 species that occur
						year-round, together with a similar number of migratory species or nomadic
						wanderers. The majority of the area’s seasonal visitors arrive in summer
						(October to March) along with the rains. They include many long-distance
						migrants from Europe and Central Asia, such as the Barn Swallow, European
						Roller, and Willow Warbler. Several European and Asian birds of prey also
						migrate to Kruger, such as the Eurasian Hobby and Red-footed Falcon.</para>
					<para xml:id="BIRD205KRUNAT_013">A host of open-country African birds are found
						in Kruger all year, from the Secretarybird, which stamps on snakes and other
						prey with its extremely long legs, to a wide range of bee-eaters, shrikes,
						pipits, larks, and francolins. The wooded areas are home to species such as
						wood hoopoes, mousebirds, starlings, and the massive-beaked Southern Ground
						Hornbill. However, one of the main highlights of the reserve is its
						impressive variety of birds of prey.</para>
					<para xml:id="BIRD205KRUNAT_014">During the winter dry season (April to
						September), birds concentrate at waterholes, rivers, and artificial dams.
						But in summer, birds are spread throughout the reserve and many species
						raise young.</para>
