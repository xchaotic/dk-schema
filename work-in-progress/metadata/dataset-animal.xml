                        Mammals, the most familiar group</phrase> of vertebrates, all nourish their young on milk produced by the femaleâ€™s mammary glands (the unique skin structures after which the class is named). Most also give birth to live young and, with only a few exceptions, have a covering of hair on their body. Mammals are most widespread and diverse on land, but they have also colonized air and water. Their success is largely due to their ability to maintain a constant internal body temperature, regardless of changing external conditions. They are also highly adaptable and often modify their behaviour to suit changing circumstances. Some mammals, especially primates (the group that includes humans), form complex societies.
