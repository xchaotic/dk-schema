<!-- "role" attribute is to be used where semantic value of the content needs to be defined, while "type" should be used where print copy needs to be followed. For instance, paras should carry a "role="leadin" in case the initial bit needs to be highlighted as leadin or the illustrations should carry "role=locator" in case these are small locator kind of maps. On the other hand, the data heads inside datasets, like weight, social unit etc. should be marked as types since they are present in/have been derived from the print and might need to be rendered verbatim in the output as well -->

		<intro id="ANIMAL012INTROD_001">
			<p>Animals form the largest of the natural world’s five kingdoms. Although they evolved after other living things, they are now the dominant form of life on earth. Among the attributes that have made them so successful are the abilities to adapt their behaviour and to move. As well as the features that set animals apart, this section looks at how they have evolved, their often complex responses to the world around them, and the way biologists classify them. It also examines the many threats they face.</p>

				<head>Characteristics of Animals</head>
				<p>Animals are usually easy to distinguish from other forms of life because most of them can move. However, while this rule works for most animals that live on land, it does not apply to many that live in water. Here, many animals spend their adult lives in one place, and some have trailing arms or tentacles that make them look very much like plants. A more reliable way of identifying animals is by their basic biological features: their bodies are composed of many cells, and they have nerves and muscles that enable them to respond to the world around them. Most important of all, they get the energy they need by taking in food.</p>
				<p>Animals are highly complex, and remarkably responsive, compared with other forms of life. Even the simplest animals react quickly to changes around them, shrinking away from potential danger or reaching out for food. Animals with well-developed nervous systems can go much further: they can learn from experience – an ability that is unique to the animal world.</p>

					<p>
						<hi role="leadin">Mammals, the most familiar</hi> group of vertebrates, all nourish their young on milk produced by the female’s mammary glands (the unique skin structures after which the class is named). Most also give birth to live young and, with only a few exceptions, have a covering of hair on their body. Mammals are most widespread and diverse on land, but they have also colonized air and water. Their success is largely due to their ability to maintain a constant internal body temperature, regardless of changing external conditions. They are also highly adaptable and often modify their behaviour to suit changing circumstances. Some mammals, especially primates (the group that includes humans), form complex societies.</p>

						<p>The spines of the Short-nosed Echidna – also called the Spiny Anteater – are longer than the fur between them. Active both day and night, this echidna is solitary and can become torpid in very cold or hot weather, when its temperature falls from the normal 31–33°C (88–92°F) to as low as 4°C (39°F). It eats a variety of ants, termites, grubs, and worms. These are detected by smell and perhaps by sensors on the long snout that detect electric signals. The small head joins the shoulders with no external neck.</p>
