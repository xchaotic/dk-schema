                <para xml:id="jac0000009" role="noindent">William Ainsworth was born in Manchester
                    on 4 February 1805. He followed his father in training as a solicitor, moving to
                    London to complete his studies at the Inner Temple. In London he established a
                    friendship with the essayist Charles Lamb and collaborated with a fellow clerk
                    in his father’s office on a romance called <emphasis role="italic">Sir John
                        Chiverton</emphasis> in 1826. The work was a popular success, attracting the
                    interest of Sir Walter Scott. In the same year Ainsworth married Fanny Ebers,
                    the daughter of his publisher. After his own brief foray into publishing he
                    turned to literary and journalistic writing as a career. His most famous work,
                        <emphasis role="italic">Rookwood</emphasis>, was published in 1834 and is
                    notable for the popularised minor character of highwayman Dick Turpin. He became
                    well known as a literary host in London, moving in the circles of Thackeray and
                    Carlyle, and mentoring the young Dickens. He edited several magazines, including
                        <emphasis role="italic">Bentley’s Miscellany</emphasis> and the <emphasis
                        role="italic">New Monthly Magazine</emphasis>, whilst steadily continuing to
                    publish his own historical romances. He continued his literary activity until
                    his death at Reigate on the 3 January 1882 and was buried at Kensal
                    Green.</para>
