            <para role="intro">Cut off by mountains from the eastern Chinese heartlands and the
                national capital in Beijing, Southwest China – the provinces of Sichuan, Chongqing,
                Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi – has always stood alone. With half of its borders
                butting up against neighbouring nations and its landmass reaching from a tropical
                coastline to the frosted peaks of the Tibetan Plateau, the Southwest’s isolation has
                long preserved great stretches of wilderness and fostered unique cultures, from Dong
                with their drum towers and indigo jackets to yak-herding, plateau-dwelling Khampa
                Tibetans. Civilizations rose and fell here for over two thousand years before the
                thirteenth-century Mongol armies made the first serious attempts to bring the entire
                Southwest under centralized control. Initial resistance and revolts over the
                centuries that followed cemented the region’s rugged image in the Chinese mind, with
                the Southwest as a romanticized frontier whose archaic customs, grand landscapes and
                wooden villages have somehow survived the frenetic modernizations sweeping the rest
                of the country.</para>

            <para>Yet whether you’re arriving from elsewhere in China or crossing one of the many
                international borders direct into the Southwest, the pace of change here is
                tangible. Modern skylines dominate the provincial capitals, motorbikes and tractors
                are replacing horses and buffalo, satellite dishes decorate remote homesteads, and
                youngsters are leaving the countryside to find work and wealth in the cities. New
                roads, rail lines and airports are bringing formerly remote outposts within
                relatively easy reach, encouraging visitors and heralding change. Travelling can
                still be an exhausting business, but it’s an exciting time to explore: little-known
                backwaters can become much-hyped tourist stops almost overnight, while adventurous
                travellers can still get away from it all on epic bus rides to giant sinkholes,
                riotous festivals and national parks that weren’t even mapped a decade ago. </para>

                <para>In contrast, western Sichuan occupies the edge of the arid, mountainous

                <para>Taking the train from arrival points is slower but also feasible. From Beijing
                    or Shanghai, you’re looking at from 28 hours to Guilin or Chengdu (¥250–800
                    depending on seat and train type) to two days to reach Kunming (¥320–900). From
                    Hong Kong, you again need to first cross into China; catch the express to
                    Guangzhou East train station (2hr 30min; HK$300), from where you can reach
                    Nanning (12hr; ¥95–285), Kunming and Guiyang (24hr; ¥175–530), and Chengdu or

                    here is to catch Hong Kong’s MTR commuter train to Lok Ma Chau (HK$45), cross
                    the Chinese border on foot, then catch a taxi (¥15–20) to Shenzhen’s huge Futian

        <para role="intro">According to the Tang poet Li Bai, the journey to his populous homeland
            of Sichuan (<phrase role="mandarinPictogram" xml:lang="zh">四川</phrase>, <phrase role="mandarinPinyin" xml:lang="zh"
                >sìchuān</phrase>) was “harder than the road to heaven”. Mountains ring the province
            and until recently the only way here was to make the dangerous trip up the Yangzi via
            the Three Gorges or follow bandit-ridden roads through gaps in the ranges to the north
            and south. Westwards – well, westwards was Tibet, which, despite centuries of trade in
            tea, horses and wool, China only had nominal control of until the 1950s. Remote, though
            cosmopolitan and never entirely isolated, Sichuan developed its own food, politics and
            lifestyle, inaccessible enough to ignore central authority and to provide sanctuary for
            those fleeing it.</para>

        <para>Sichuan splits into very different halves, cut by a diagonal range of hills that slant
            southwest across the province – and which, as the terrible <phrase rend="b">2008
                earthquake</phrase> proved, follow a tectonic fault. <phrase rend="b">East</phrase>
            of this line, the subtropical Red Basin is one of China’s most densely settled areas, an
            engaging mosaic of unusual historic sites, lively cities and rural scenery whose fertile
            soil produces three harvests a year; hit the region in spring, and hills are covered in
            a sea of brilliant yellow rape flowers. Among all this bounty sits <phrase role="POI_ref"
                >Chengdu</phrase>, Sichuan’s relaxed but overcrowded capital, whose teahouse culture
            and panda breeding centre make for an enjoyable few days’ stopover. Packed with antique
            buildings and cobbled lanes, attractive <phrase role="POI_ref">Pingle</phrase> and larger
                <phrase role="POI_ref">Langzhong</phrase> are the pick of the old towns nearby,
            though quirky <phrase role="POI_ref">Zigong</phrase> not only sports impressive
            architecture, but also salt mines and a dinosaur museum. Imperial patronage of Buddhism
            saw religious sites flourish over a thousand years ago during the Tang dynasty, best
            experienced at the hulking, aptly named Big Buddha at <phrase role="POI_ref"
                >Leshan</phrase>, and Emei Shan, a forested holy mountain with over 65km of hiking
            tracks linking dozens of temples, in which visitors and pilgrims can stay overnight. </para>

        <section role="article">
            <title>language</title>
            <para>Used by over a billion people, China’s national language, Mandarin, has more
                native speakers than English and Spanish combined. While Southwest China is also
                rife with heavy accents and regional dialects, Mandarin, the language of education,
                is the default everywhere – indeed, its Chinese name, putonghua, translates as
                “common language” – and a grasp of even the basics will massively enhance your trip.
                Be aware, however, that some Chinese peoples, such as Miao, Yi and Tibetans, speak
                their own entirely different languages, though you’d be very unlucky to wind up
                somewhere Mandarin isn’t understood at all. Foreign languages – primarily English –
                are spoken to some extent by many students, and at upmarket hotels and places where
                Western tourists are common; elsewhere you’ll need at least a phrasebook.</para>

                <title>Speaking Mandarin</title>
                <para>Despite Chinese being seen as difficult for Western students to learn, in many
                    ways spoken Mandarin is relatively easy, as <phrase rend="b">grammatical
                        rules</phrase> are straightforward: there are no plurals, no agreements, no
                    declensions, no genders and no tenses. Instead, <phrase rend="b"
                        >context</phrase> and fairly rigid rules about <phrase rend="b">word
                        order</phrase> are key, along with words such as “some”, “many”, “yesterday”
                    or “tomorrow”.</para>
                <para>For English-speakers, Chinese word order follows the familiar
                    subject-verb-object pattern, and you’ll find that by simply stringing words
                    together you’ll be producing comprehensible basic Chinese. Just note that
                    adjectives, as well as all qualifying and describing phrases, <phrase rend="b"

                    <para>There are <phrase rend="b">four tones</phrase> in Mandarin, and almost
                        every syllable is characterized by one of them. While often seen as a major
                        issue, actually pronouncing these tones is not difficult, as they are also
                        used in English. The difference is that English uses tone for <phrase
                            rend="b">effect</phrase> – emphasis, questioning, listing, rebuking -
                        while in Mandarin, using a different tone changes the word’s actual <phrase
                            rend="b">meaning</phrase>, rather like vowels in English (think of
                        saying “wall” instead of “well”). The wrong tone used with
                            <foreignphrase>ma</foreignphrase>, for example, can turn “mother” into
                        “horse” or “hemp”. </para>

            <title>a rough guide to Rough Guides</title>
            <para>Published in 1982, the first Rough Guide – to Greece – was a student scheme that became a publishing phenomenon. Mark Ellingham, a recent graduate in English from Bristol University, had been travelling in Greece the previous summer and couldn’t find the right guidebook. With a small group of friends he wrote his own guide, combining a highly contemporary, journalistic style with a thoroughly practical approach to travellers’ needs.</para>
            <para>The immediate success of the book spawned a series that rapidly covered dozens of destinations. And, in addition to impecunious backpackers, Rough Guides soon acquired a much broader readership that relished the guides’ wit and inquisitiveness as much as their enthusiastic, critical approach and value-for-money ethos.</para>
            <para>These days, Rough Guides include recommendations from budget to luxury and cover more than 200 destinations around the globe, as well as producing an ever-growing range of eBooks and apps.</para>

                <para>We’ve gone to a lot of effort to ensure that the first edition of The Rough Guide to Southwest China is accurate and up-to-date. However, things change – places get “discovered”, opening hours are notoriously fickle, restaurants and rooms raise prices or lower standards. If you feel we’ve got it wrong or left something out, we’d like to know, and if you can remember the address, the price, the hours, the phone number, so much the better. </para>
